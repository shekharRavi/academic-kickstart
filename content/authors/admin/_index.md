I am a Post-Doctoral researcher at the [Computational Linguistics Lab](http://compling.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) working with [Matthew Purver](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~mpurver/). I am working on the [EMBEDDIA](http://embeddia.eu/) project to summarize the user-generated content. 

In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. at [DISI](https://ict.unitn.it/), the [University of Trento](https://unitn.it/). I was supervised by [Raffaella Bernardi](http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/), University of Trento, and co-supervised by [Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/), University of Amsterdam. I focused on understanding what language and vision model learns. I was also a visiting scholar for a short time at
[Dialogue Modelling Group](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/dialogue-group.php), University of Amsterdam. During my Ph.D., I collaborated with multiple researchers; [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/), [Aurélie Herbelot](http://aurelieherbelot.net/), [Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/), [Enver Sangineto](https://disi.unitn.it/~enver.sangineto/index.html), [Moin Nabi](https://moinnabi.github.io/), and [others](./collaborators/)

Prior to my Ph.D., I was research assistant at the University of Malaya working with [C. S. Chan](http://web.fsktm.um.edu.my/~cschan/). I received my M.S. (by Research) Degree with a focus on Computer Vision from [CVIT](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) under the supervision of [C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer for [Accenture Services Pvt. Limited](https://www.accenture.com/).
